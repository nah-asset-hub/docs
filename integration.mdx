## Integration Overview

- We  currently provide REST API with OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
- We differentiate between sandbox & production API so you can safely test your implementation in sandbox mode. Sandbox environment will not initiate any real transaction and it's designed for testing purposes. Sandbox Base URL: https://api-sandbox.durian-x.com/v1.0
- Credentials needed for integration:
  - Sandbox Account - you can request account creation via our BD team \<TBC Email\>. After account creation we will share to you
    - **Sandbox X-CLIENT-ID**
    - **Sandbox Secret Key**
    - **Sandbox Public key of NAH**
  - Prepare Sandbox Webhook URL
  - Prepare your own Sandbox Private & Public Key. Step to generate your private key and public key is as following.

  ```shellscript
  # generate merchant's private key
  openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
  # Generate Public Key
  openssl rsa -in rsa_private_key.pem -out rsa_public_key.pem -pubout
  ```

  _Please store your private key securely. The public key will need to be shared to NAH._
  - Request for sandbox setup to NAH. \
    To setup your sandbox settings, you can send an email to \<TBC Tech Onboarding Email\> with the following Subject: "Request for sandbox configuration". The request should include
    - Sandbox Public Key to be shared to us in encrypted file to \<TBC Tech Onboarding Email\>. Password to be shared in different channel / same channel (i.e. Email, Whatsapp, Telegram) with different PIC
    - Sandbox Webhook URL

- Failure and retry points
  - Rate Expired -\> We recommend you handle this by re-quote the transaction and execute it with the newest quote
  - Handling of timeout for transaction notification.
    - We currently provide webhook handling for Crypto Deposit transaction & Swap transaction with the following event: swap.executed , asset.deposited. If you have configured the webhook URL, when ack is not received by us, we will retry the webhook for 5 times with exponential interval.
    - If there are any timeout for the transaction, we recommend you check the status of transaction using get API for the transaction.

## Authentication and Security

- Access Token Handling
- Signature Handling

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

NAH will return common error as following when you are requesting API to our end.

| HTTP Error Code | Message                   | Handling                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 500             | StatusInternalServerError | Retry / Raise to NAH for the issue                           |
| 400             | StatusBadRequest          | Re-check the structure of the request body                   |
| 401             | StatusUnauthorized        | Re-check authorization handling from your end (Access Token) |

In addition to this , there will be specific error for each of the API you will access.

### Quote Expired

In case of a quote is expired, you cannot use it for the swap transaction. Therefore you need to handle from your end to re-quote in case of expired quote

### Timeout Handling

- 

### Duplicate Request Handling

- 

## Off-Ramp Integration Steps

### **1.  Supporting Information**

- \*\*Get Supported Digital Asset: \*\*Return information of digital asset supported & supporting information related to the asset
- \*\*Get Supported Swap Pairs: \*\*Return information of swap pairs supported

### **2. Accounts**

Account represent a wallet/ balance for your digital asset. An Account will represent 1 digital asset per provider/CEX.

- Get Accounts
- Get Account by ID
- Get Account Ledger

### **3.  Deposits**

Deposit represent both the deposit address and the transaction. Deposit address will be generated for the digital asset, and once there's a transfer to the deposit address, deposit transaction will be created. Successful deposit will add the balance to your digital asset account

**Deposit Transaction Status Lifecycle**

| Status    | Definition                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| completed | Deposit transaction is success and balance will be credited according to the deposit transaction amount |
| failed    | Deposit transaction is failed  and your balance will not be credited                                    |

- Create Deposit Address
- Get Deposit Transactions
- Get Deposit Transaction by ID
- Deposit Transaction Webhook Handling

### **4.  Quotes**

Quote represent inquiring rate from the provider/ CEX. This quote can then be used to execute the swap transaction (fiat - digital asset, digital asset - fiat , digital asset - digital asset)

**Status Lifecycle**

| Status  | Definition                                   |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| active  | Quote is ready to use for transaction        |
| used    | Quote is already executed for swap           |
| expired | Quote is expired and cannot be used for swap |

  style={{ width:"20%" }}
/>

- Create Quote
- Get Quotes
- Get Quote by ID

### **5.  Swaps**

Swap represent execution of a conversion transaction from fiat - digital asset, digital asset - fiat , digital asset - digital asset. To execute swap , you need to first quote the rate first.

**Status Lifecycle**

| Status     | Definition                                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| processing | Swap initial phase after executed                  |
| completed  | Swap is successfuly executed by the CEX / partner  |
| failed     | Swap is failed to be executed by the CEX / partner |

- Get Swaps
- Get Swap by ID
- Swap Webhook handling

## Webhooks and Events

- List of webhook event types:

| Event           | When it's fired                                                         | Case      |

- Handling of timeout for webhook/transaction notification.
  - We currently provide webhook handling for Crypto Deposit transaction & Swap transaction with the following event: swap.executed , asset.deposited. If you have configured the webhook URL, when ack is not received by us, we will retry the webhook for 5 times with exponential interval.
  - If there are any timeout for the transaction, we recommend you check the status of transaction using get API for the transaction.
