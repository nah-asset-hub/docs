## Integration Overview

- We  currently provide REST API with OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
- We differentiate between sandbox & production API so you can safely test your implementation in sandbox mode. Sandbox environment will not initiate any real transaction and it's designed for testing purposes. Sandbox Base URL: https://api-sandbox.durian-x.com/v1.0
- Credentials needed for integration:
  - Sandbox Account - you can request account creation via our BD team \<TBC Email\>. After account creation we will share to you
    - Sandbox X-CLIENT-ID
    - Sandbox Secret Key
    - Sandbox Public key of NAH
  - Prepare Sandbox Webhook URL
  - Prepare your own Sandbox Private & Public Key. Step to generate your private key and public key is as following.

  ```shellscript
  # generate merchant's private key
  openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
  # Generate Public Key
  openssl rsa -in rsa_private_key.pem -out rsa_public_key.pem -pubout
  ```

  _Please store your private key securely. The public key will need to be shared to NAH._
  - Request for sandbox setup to NAH. \
    To setup your sandbox settings, you can send an email to \<TBC Tech Onboarding Email\> with the following Subject: "Request for sandbox configuration". The request should include
    - Sandbox Public Key to be shared to us in encrypted file to \<TBC Tech Onboarding Email\>. Password to be shared in different channel / same channel (i.e. Email, Whatsapp, Telegram) with different PIC
    - Sandbox Webhook URL

- Signature Handling

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Common Error

For any success case, NAH will return 2XX HTTP Code as the response, however NAH will return these common error as following if there's an error happening for your request.

| HTTP Error Code | Message                   | Handling                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 500             | StatusInternalServerError | Retry / Raise to NAH for the issue                           |
| 400             | StatusBadRequest          | Re-check the structure of the request body                   |
| 401             | StatusUnauthorized        | Re-check authorization handling from your end (Access Token) |

In addition to this , there will be specific error for each of the API you will access.

**Specific API Error**

| API          | HTTP Error Code          | Code & Message             | Handling                                                                                   | Sample Error                                                                           |
| ------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create Swap  | 404 Not Found            | INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS         | Check your current account balance & deposit fund                                          | \{ "code": INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS<br />"message: "insufficient balance on source asset" \}   |
| Create Swap  | 422 Unprocessable Entity | QUOTE_NOT_FOUND_OR_EXPIRED | Quote is expired/ Not found, please re-generate new quote                                  | \{"code": "QUOTE_NOT_FOUND_OR_EXPIRED", "message": "quoteId is invalid or expired" \}     |
| Create Quote | 400 Bad Request          | QUOTE_INVALID_AMOUNT       | Quote is not within the amount limit, Please re-generate new quote within the amount limit | \{ "code": "QUOTE_INVALID_AMOUNT", "message": "amount must be between 100 and 100000" \} |

### 

### Quote Expired

In case of a quote is expired, you cannot use it for the swap transaction. Therefore you need to handle from your end to re-quote in case of expired quote

### Timeout Handling

- 

### Duplicate Request Handling

- 

**Failure and retry points**

Here's the following failure & retry point you need to handle from your end

- Rate Expired -\> We recommend you handle this by re-quote the transaction and execute it with the newest quote
- Handling timeout when requesting a transaction
  - We recommend you to get the status of the transaction.
- Handling of timeout for transaction notification
  - We currently provide webhook retry. If you have configured the webhook URL, when ack is not received by us, we will retry the webhook for 5 times with exponential interval.
  - If there are any timeout for the transaction / webhook notification, we recommend you check the status of transaction using get API to update your internal status.

## Off-Ramp Integration Steps

### **1.  Supporting Information**

- \*\*Get Supported Digital Asset: \*\*Return information of digital asset supported & supporting information related to the asset
- \*\*Get Supported Swap Pairs: \*\*Return information of swap pairs supported

### **2. Accounts**

Account represent a wallet/ balance for your digital asset. An Account will represent 1 digital asset per provider/CEX.

- Get Accounts
- Get Account by ID
- Get Account Ledger

### **3.  Deposits**

Deposit represent both the deposit address and the transaction. Deposit address will be generated for the digital asset, and once there's a transfer to the deposit address, deposit transaction will be created. Successful deposit will add the balance to your digital asset account

**Deposit Transaction Status Lifecycle**

| Status    | Definition                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| completed | Deposit transaction is success and balance will be credited according to the deposit transaction amount |
| failed    | Deposit transaction is failed  and your balance will not be credited                                    |

  style={{ width:"25%" }}
/>

- Create Deposit Address
- Get Deposit Transactions
- Get Deposit Transaction by ID
- Deposit Transaction Webhook Handling

### **4.  Quotes**

Quote represent inquiring rate from the provider/ CEX. This quote can then be used to execute the swap transaction (fiat - digital asset, digital asset - fiat , digital asset - digital asset)

**Status Lifecycle**

| Status  | Definition                                   |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| active  | Quote is ready to use for transaction        |
| used    | Quote is already executed for swap           |
| expired | Quote is expired and cannot be used for swap |

<img
  src="/images/image-10.png"

  title="Image"
  style={{ width:"20%" }}
/>

- Create Quote
- Get Quotes
- Get Quote by ID

### **5.  Swaps**

Swap represent execution of a conversion transaction from fiat - digital asset, digital asset - fiat , digital asset - digital asset. To execute swap , you need to first quote the rate first.

**Status Lifecycle**

| Status     | Definition                                         |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| processing | Swap initial phase after executed                  |
| completed  | Swap is successfuly executed by the CEX / partner  |
| failed     | Swap is failed to be executed by the CEX / partner |

- Create Swap
- Get Swaps
- Get Swap by ID
- Swap Webhook handling

## Webhooks and Events

- List of webhook event types:

| Event           | When it's fired                                                         | Case      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| asset.deposited | When a crypto asset is credited to your crypto account in the CEX       | Completed |
| swap.executed   | When a swap (Crypto - Fiat or Fiat - Crypto) is successfuly processed   | Completed |
| swap.executed   | When a swap (Crypto - Fiat or Fiat - Crypto) is  processed with failure | Failed    |

- Handling of timeout for webhook/transaction notification.
  - We currently provide webhook handling for Crypto Deposit transaction & Swap transaction with the following event: swap.executed , asset.deposited. If you have configured the webhook URL, when ack is not received by us, we will retry the webhook for 5 times with exponential interval.
  - If there are any timeout for the transaction, we recommend you check the status of transaction using get API for the transaction.

## How to test your implementation

- We provide sandbox environment for you to test your implementation before going live. Currently the sandbox environment is supported only via API
  - Sandbox Base URL: https://api-sandbox.durian-x.com/v1.0
- To simulate certain error cases in each of the API you can use the following Header to simulate the transaction
  - X-SANDBOX-ERROR
  - X-SIMULATE-SANDBOX-TRX

## Sandbox limitations

- For Asset API we currently always set static balance information for the transaction

## Simulating Edge Cases in Sandbox

### Crypto Deposit

| **Case Handling** | **Header Value**                                                              | **Output sample**                                                                                                                                    |
