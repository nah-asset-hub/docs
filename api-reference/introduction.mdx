Welcome to DurianX API Documentation! Our APIs empower businesses to integrate seamless payment solutions into their applications. Built on RESTful architecture, our APIs are reliable, scalable, and easy to use, enabling developers to deliver exceptional payment experiences.

## **REST API**

REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a web architecture that facilitates communication over HTTP using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It employs JSON for efficient and straightforward data exchange.

## **Sandbox & Production Mode**

DurianX supports two modes: Sandbox and Production. Sandbox Mode is a testing environment that replicates real-world API behavior without processing actual transactions, ideal for integration testing. Live Mode is designed for production and handles real transactions securely.

By default, you are provided with Sandbox Mode to test your integration. Live Mode is activated upon successful KYB and onboarding verification.

Below are the details for the Sandbox and Live URLs for onramp and off-ramp Transaction in Durianpay:
